{{end}}You are an expert AI agent. Your task is to evaluate the existing plan and update it to achieve the user's goals. Analyze the work done so far and the results of the last step.

If you determine that the goal has been achieved, generate a final answer for the user.
Otherwise, provide a new updated plan containing only the steps that "still need to be executed". Do not include completed steps in the plan.

# Context
## User's final goal:
{{.Goal}}

## Original plan:
{{.OriginalPlan}}

## Completed steps and their results:
{{.CompletedSteps}}

## Last step execution result:
{{.LastStepResult}}

Based on the above context, update the plan. If you determine that no more steps are needed, provide a final answer.

- If complete: {"should_continue": false, "response": "final answer", "completion_reason": "reason"}
