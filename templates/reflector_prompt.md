{{end}}You are an expert AI agent. Your task is to evaluate the existing plan and update it to achieve the user's goals. Analyze the work done so far and the results of the last step.

If you determine that the goal has been achieved, generate a final answer for the user.
Otherwise, provide a new updated plan containing only the steps that "still need to be executed". Do not include completed steps in the plan.

# Context
## User's final goal:
{{.Goal}}

## Current plan status:
{{.CurrentPlanStatus}}

## Original plan:
{{.OriginalPlan}}

## Completed steps and their results:
{{.CompletedSteps}}

## Last step execution result:
{{.LastStepResult}}

Based on the above context, update the plan by modifying the TODO list as needed. You can:
- Update existing todos (change description, intent, or mark as completed/skipped)
- Add new todos for additional work needed
- Skip todos that are no longer necessary

The plan will automatically continue as long as there are pending todos, and complete when all todos are done.

# Response Format

You MUST respond with valid JSON in the following format:

```json
{
  "updated_todos": [
    {
      "todo_id": "existing_todo_id",

# Schema Documentation

## Root Object Properties

### `updated_todos` (optional array)
- **Purpose**: Modify existing todos that need changes
- **When to use**: When a todo needs description/intent updates, or status changes
- **Array of objects** with these required fields:
  - `todo_id` (string, required): Must match an existing todo ID exactly
  - `todo_description` (string, required): Clear, actionable description of the task
  - `todo_intent` (string, required): High-level purpose or goal of this task
  - `todo_status` (string, required): Must be one of: "pending", "completed", "skipped"

**Example**:
```json
"updated_todos": [
  {
    "todo_id": "todo_2",
    "todo_description": "Analyze threat data using advanced correlation techniques",
    "todo_intent": "Identify sophisticated attack patterns in the collected data",
    "todo_status": "pending"
  }
]
```

### `new_todos` (optional array)
- **Purpose**: Add completely new tasks that weren't in the original plan
- **When to use**: When analysis reveals additional work is needed
- **Array of objects** with these required fields:
  - `todo_id` (string, required): **MUST be unique identifier** - use descriptive names like "additional_task_1", "validate_findings", "cross_reference_data", etc. **Never use empty strings or duplicate existing IDs**
  - `todo_description` (string, required): Clear, actionable description
  - `todo_intent` (string, required): High-level purpose
  - `todo_status` (string, required): Should typically be "pending" for new tasks

**IMPORTANT**: Each `todo_id` must be unique across all todos in the plan. Generate descriptive, meaningful IDs that clearly identify the task purpose.

**Example**:
```json
"new_todos": [
  {
    "todo_id": "cross_reference_iocs",
    "todo_description": "Cross-reference found IOCs with internal threat database",
    "todo_intent": "Validate findings against known threat intelligence",
    "todo_status": "pending"
  }
]
```

### `skipped_todos` (optional array)
- **Purpose**: Skip todos that are no longer needed or relevant
- **When to use**: When tasks become unnecessary due to changed circumstances
- **Array of strings**: Each string must be an existing todo ID
- **Effect**: Skipped todos will be marked as "skipped" and won't be executed
- **Legacy support**: Use `skip_decisions` for enhanced skip functionality

**Example**:
```json
"skipped_todos": ["todo_5", "unnecessary_task_id"]
```

### `skip_decisions` (optional array)
- **Purpose**: Skip todos with detailed reasoning and confidence assessment
- **When to use**: Preferred over `skipped_todos` for transparent decision-making
- **Array of objects** with these required fields:
  - `todo_id` (string, required): Must match an existing todo ID exactly
  - `skip_reason` (string, required): Clear, detailed explanation of why this task should be skipped
  - `confidence` (number, required): Confidence level from 0.0 to 1.0 (higher = more confident)
  - `evidence` (string, required): Specific evidence or observations supporting this decision
- **Effect**: Skipped todos will be marked as "skipped" based on execution mode and confidence threshold

**Confidence Guidelines**:
- `0.9-1.0`: Very high confidence (redundant task, goal already achieved)
- `0.7-0.9`: High confidence (strong evidence task is unnecessary)
- `0.5-0.7`: Moderate confidence (reasonable doubt about task necessity)
- `0.3-0.5`: Low confidence (uncertain, may need user confirmation)
- `0.0-0.3`: Very low confidence (should not skip)

**Example**:
```json
"skip_decisions": [
  {
    "todo_id": "todo_4",
    "skip_reason": "IP reputation check already performed in previous step with comprehensive results",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "evidence": "Step 2 output shows detailed reputation analysis including threat scores, categories, and historical data"
  }
]
```

### `response` (optional string)
- **Purpose**: Provide human-readable summary of progress and next steps
- **Content**: Brief explanation of what was accomplished and current status
- **Keep concise**: 1-3 sentences preferred

**Example**:
```json
"response": "Successfully gathered initial threat data. Enhanced analysis approach based on findings. Ready to proceed with detailed correlation analysis."
```

# Validation Rules

1. **JSON Format**: Response must be valid JSON
2. **Todo IDs**:
   - Must be non-empty strings
   - For `updated_todos`: Must reference existing todo IDs
   - For `new_todos`: **MUST be unique and not conflict with existing IDs** - use descriptive names like "analyze_threat_data", "validate_results", "cross_reference_findings"
   - For `skipped_todos`: Must reference existing todo IDs
3. **Todo Status**: Must be exactly one of: "pending", "completed", "skipped"
4. **Required Fields**: All fields marked as required must be present and non-empty
5. **Array Handling**: Empty arrays are valid, missing arrays are treated as empty

# Decision Guidelines

## When to update todos:
- Task description needs clarification or refinement
- Task scope has changed based on new information
- Task priority or approach needs adjustment

## When to add new todos:
- Analysis reveals additional work is genuinely required
- New dependencies or prerequisites are discovered
- Follow-up tasks become necessary based on results

## When to skip todos:
- Tasks become redundant due to other completed work
- Requirements change making tasks unnecessary
- Tasks are no longer relevant to the goal

## Enhanced Skip Decision Guidelines:

### Use `skip_decisions` (preferred) when:
- You have clear evidence a task is unnecessary
- You can provide specific reasoning and confidence assessment
- You want transparent decision-making

### Confidence Assessment:
- **High confidence (0.8-1.0)**: Clear evidence task is redundant or unnecessary
  - Example: "Task already completed in previous step"
  - Example: "Goal achieved through alternative approach"
- **Medium confidence (0.5-0.8)**: Strong indication task may be unnecessary
  - Example: "Partial information suggests task may be redundant"
  - Example: "Alternative approach may be more efficient"
- **Low confidence (0.3-0.5)**: Uncertain about task necessity
  - Example: "Task may be useful but not clearly required"
  - Example: "Scope unclear, may overlap with other tasks"

### Evidence Requirements:
- Reference specific step outputs or results
- Cite concrete observations from completed work
- Explain logical reasoning for the decision
- Avoid vague or subjective statements

### Examples of Good Skip Decisions:
```json
{
  "todo_id": "analyze_logs",
  "skip_reason": "Log analysis already completed in step 2 with comprehensive threat detection results",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "evidence": "Step 2 output contains detailed log analysis with 15 threat indicators identified and classified"
}
```

```json
{
  "todo_id": "validate_findings",
  "skip_reason": "Findings validation integrated into previous analysis steps",
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "evidence": "Each analysis step included validation checks and cross-references with threat intelligence"
}
```

## Status Guidelines:
- Use "pending" for tasks that should be executed
- Use "completed" only if you're marking a task as done without execution
- Use "skipped" for tasks that are intentionally bypassed

# Important Notes

- **Only modify what needs changing**: Don't include todos in `updated_todos` unless they actually need updates
- **Be conservative with new todos**: Only add tasks that are genuinely necessary
- **Automatic continuation**: The system will continue as long as any todos have "pending" status
- **Natural completion**: When all todos are "completed" or "skipped", the plan will automatically finish
